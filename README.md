Rock-Paper-Scissors game

#Business scenario
- The application should implement Rock-Paper-Scissors game
- The game is played between a player and the application
- There could be many players with different names playing in parallel
- One player can play many rounds
- A round of the game is when a player ‘throws’ rock, paper or scissors shapes. The application, in turn, generates an arbitrary choice of a shape and announces the winner of the round: player or the application.
- Each round of the game can have possible outcomes:
  - Draw (player and the application have same shapes)
  - Win or Loss for a player (see common rock-paper-scissors rules)
- The application should be able to provide player’s statistics, e.g. rounds played, wins, losses…
